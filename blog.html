            <h4>Traditional method of woving Khadi</h4>
            <p>At the time of fast fashion, the usage of khadi remains relatively low. Most of us are lured into either an H&M or a Zara store. The fast fashion industry manages to mass produce garments at low rates by outsourcing production to third world countries.

            <h4>Khadi is being recognised internationally..isn't it interesting..?</h4>
            <p>There is a sudden rise in awareness about sustainable fashion in the world. In a world where we are going back to our roots even as we are contemporising everything, our choices are slowly becoming more conscious. In the fashion industry at home, Indian handloom has seen a huge rise in demand and popularity. From silk to tussar to cotton to chanderi, there is a revival and a return to the roots. Organic is in and less is more. And with that, khadi has once again caught attention.

            <h4>Everything can be made out of KHADI</h4>
            <p>Fibre Bio’s Khadi is made of hand-spun and hand-woven cotton from India. The Khadi became famous in the world thanks to Mahatma Gandhi who made it one of the symbols of the fight against British colonialism.

            <h4>KHADI is not costly Anymore</h4>
            <p>When one says ‘khadi’ the word itself springs up a variety of emotions. Though khadi is a hand woven cloth, its meaning and relation to the freedom struggle of India is legendary to say the least. Khadi has a long and winding history and the evidence of its presence has been from around the times of Mohenjodaro and the Indus Valley Civilization. It has seen its share of ups and downs, however, unlike many other handicrafts or handlooms, khadi transcends the line of mere clothing or garment value to reach almost the cult status of an iconic significance under Mahatma Gandhi.
